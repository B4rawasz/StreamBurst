# What is a module?

Module is a basic component of Stream Burst. It allows you to standardize communication with external applications. Thanks to them, you can see animations and responsive overlays on streams.

# How to create a module?

You have two options to choose from. Start working with the template module, or start from scratch.

<span className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 w-full *:h-16">
	<Button variant="outline" asChild>
		<Link href="./modules/template" className=" no-underline">
			<Package />
			Start with template
		</Link>
	</Button>

    <Button variant="outline" asChild>
    	<Link href="./modules/scratch" className=" no-underline">
    		<Blocks />
    		Start from scratch
    	</Link>
    </Button>

</span>
