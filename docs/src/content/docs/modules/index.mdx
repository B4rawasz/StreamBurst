## What is a module?

Module is a basic component of Stream Burst. It allows you to standardize communication with external applications. Thanks to them, you can see animations and responsive overlays on streams.

## How to create a module?

You have two options to choose from. Start working with the template module, or start from scratch.

<LinkCards>

    <LinkCard href="./modules/template">
    	<Package />
    	Start with template
    </LinkCard>

    <LinkCard href="./modules/scratch">
    	<Blocks />
    	Start from scratch
    </LinkCard>
